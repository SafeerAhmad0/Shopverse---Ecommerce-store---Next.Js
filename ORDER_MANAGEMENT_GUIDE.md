3. Click **"New Query"**
4. Copy the entire contents of `supabase_migrations/orders_migration.sql`

   - Add some products to cart
   - Go to `/checkout`
   - Fill in billing information
   - Click **"Confirm & Place Order"**
   - You'll be redirected to success page
   - Cart will be cleared automatically

3. **View orders** (Super Admin flow):
   - Login as super_admin at `/admin/login`
   - Click the **"Orders"** tab
   - See all orders in the system
   - Click "View Details" on any order
   - Update order status and payment status
